# Extract information using Regex. Dedup data
## About
In this repository, I learned to build Regex and used it to extract information from strings. I also found duplicated data using groupby function and FuzzyWuzzy package.<br>
This dataset is messier than I expected, so it took quite a long time for me to get the desired result.<br>

Data Source: [Hawaii Farmer's Markets](https://data.hawaii.gov/Economic-Development/Hawaii-Farmer-s-Markets/nqfm-3etr/data)
