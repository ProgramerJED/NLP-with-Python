This folder includes an Excel data file and a Jupyter Notebook in which I applied FuzzyWuzzy package to find similar strings within a column.<br><br>
Data Source: [The Ramen Rater's Big List](https://www.theramenrater.com/resources-2/the-list/)<br>
The data store information of multiple types of ramen coming from different brands and styles. In this example, I only focus on the ramen brand names.
